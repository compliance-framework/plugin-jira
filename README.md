# Jira Compliance Plugin

This plugin for the `compliance-framework` evaluates Jira and Jira Service Management (JSM) data to ensure Change Request processes are properly followed prior to new deployments.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supports OAuth2 (2-Legged OAuth / Client Credentials) and API Tokens.
- **Data Collection**:
    - **Jira Platform**: Projects, Workflows, Schemes, Issue Types, Custom Fields, Audit Records, and Permissions.
    - **Jira Service Management**: Native Approvals and SLAs.
    - **Jira Software**: Development Information (GitHub PRs/commits) and Deployment events.
- **Policy Evaluation**: Integration with OPA policies to calculate compliance evidence based on collected Jira metadata.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Authentication Setup

The plugin supports two authentication methods:

#### Option A: Service Account + OAuth2 (Recommended for Cloud)
This method uses Jira's [OAuth 2.0 (3LO) for apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) or more specifically, for service-to-service integrations, you typically use [API Tokens with a Service Account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/) or [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-client-credentials-apps/) (if available for your organization).

**How to set up a Service Account:**
1. Create a dedicated Atlassian account (e.g., `compliance-bot@yourcompany.com`).
2. Invite this account to your Jira instance.
3. Follow Atlassian's guide on [Service Accounts](https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/use-service-accounts/).

#### Option B: API Token (Fallback)
1. Log in to Jira as the Service Account.
2. Go to **Account Settings > Security > API Tokens**.
3. Create a new API token and save it securely.

### 2. Minimal Permissions (Scopes)

The Service Account needs the following minimal permissions to collect compliance data:

- **Global Permissions**:
    - `Browse Users` (to see approvers and authors)
- **Project Permissions (for all target projects)**:
    - `Browse Projects`
    - `View Development Tools` (for Software API dev links)
    - `Administer Projects` (optional, for detailed workflow/scheme inspection)
- **OAuth Scopes (Cloud)**:
    - `read:jira-work`
    - `read:jira-user`
    - `read:servicedesk-request`
    - `manage:jira-configuration` (for workflows and schemes)

## Configuration

The plugin is configured via the `PluginConfig` structure:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `base_url` | The URL of your Jira instance (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`) |
| `auth_type` | `oauth2` or `token` |
| `client_id` | OAuth2 Client ID (for `oauth2` auth) |
| `client_secret` | OAuth2 Client Secret (for `oauth2` auth) |
| `api_token` | API Token (for `token` auth) |
| `user_email` | Service Account email (for `token` auth) |
| `project_keys` | Comma-separated list of Project Keys to monitor |
| `policy_labels` | JSON map of labels to attach to generated evidence |

## Usage

The plugin implements the `Runner` interface and is executed by the compliance agent.

```bash
# Example execution (internal to framework)
./plugin-jira --config config.json
```
